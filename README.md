# Hi, I'm Antti Rask!

I'm a data person from Finland. I love working with data, learning new things, and sharing what I learn along the way.

## What I Do

- **Data Analysis & Visualization**, mainly with R, ggplot2, and the rest of the tidyverse
- **Machine Learning** using tidymodels
- **Shiny Apps** for interactive data applications
- **Power BI & DAX** for business intelligence
- Other projects, like the one with **Spotify API** that combines music and data
- Nowadays I also use **Claude Code** (like everyone else and their grandmas) and **Python** for some of the projects
    - While I don't think that **AI** is the answer to all our problems, it does make coding easier/faster
    - And as mentioned, I like learning new things, which is another reason I've kept an open mind

## Blog(s)

- I have two Substack channels:
    - [ggplot2 extended](https://ggplot2extended.substack.com/) is for all the R stuff, including BTS for the book I'm writing
    - And [youcanbeapiRate](https://youcanbeapirate.substack.com/) is for everything else I'm interested in
- I used to write about R and data analysis in my blog: [Why Join the Navy When You Can Be a piRate](https://www.youcanbeapirate.com/).
    - It still exists, but hasn't been updated in a while
